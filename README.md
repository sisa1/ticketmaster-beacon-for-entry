Code for ASU capstone project worked on during the Fall 2014 & Spring 2015 semesters. <br>
This project was sponsored by ticketmaster in order to create a hands-free, paperless 
event entry system. It uses a phone app, servlet, and website system to provide ticketmaster 
customers a high tech way to automatically scan their tickets using low-energy beacon technology. 
This repository includes code from our servlet and the website. It does not include code for our app or our database.
