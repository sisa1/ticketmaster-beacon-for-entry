### Brief Project Description ###

> Ticketmaster Beacon provides a way to process user's ticket entry at an event in an efficient manner. Users should be able to attend an event and reproduce their ticket on their android phone. Admin users can see and review incoming clients and change their event status.

> Some features may also include a beacon that can broadcast what event is taking place, and who has attended. The beacon will provide almost a public domain where users attending the same event may be able to communicate with one another and Admins can monitor or record this information
